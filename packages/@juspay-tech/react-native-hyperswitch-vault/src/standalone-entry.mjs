 * The names are the web SDK's: `cardNumber`, `cardExpiry`, `cardCvc` become `CardNumberField`,
 * `CardExpiryField`, `CardCVCField`. The legacy `*Widget` spellings, the `HyperswitchVault`
 * namespace and the standalone saved-card form were removed with that alignment; a saved card is
 * now `<CardCVCField savedCard={...} />` inside `<CardForm>`, as it is on the web.
